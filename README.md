## What is this project about?
This project is a big dream of one young game developer that had once played in Undertale (by Toby Fox) and loved it at first glance. Impressed by the game, ideas of breathing a second life in it and make the game graphic better didn't leave him. This young man met a lot of interesting people, friends, and developers that not only support this project but also agreed to help with work on it. It was needed 4 years for this little plan, a tiny ambitious dream started to come true. And right now I happy to tell that everyone who wants to see and fully tastes the Undertale reborn in the 3D version can join us in its creation. So less said, soonest manded: welcome to Undertale 3D!! Took part in the project, and make your personal contribution in game creation, developing, testing, discussion, sharing, and even more!

A graphical fun remake of the popular game - Undertale by Toby Fox, with gameplay adaptations to 3-dimensional space. Our major objective is to change all environments to 3D models, redraw cut-scenes and adapt old game mechanics (like battle system) to the new environment.

## The Wiki
In the Wiki, throughout the development will be described all specific requirements, models, interfaces, code architectures and solutions, sounds, cut-scenes and, of course, game mechanics and processes. Actually, here we are telling all the needed information about the future game!
